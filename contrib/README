These are user contributed scripts that automate testing. These all
depend on using "make check", so they are included here as an aid to
helping others automate their own testing. All of these scripts do
report filtering on the output from DejaGnu.

test-tool and test-g++ are basically the same script.

testit is a very crude and simple Tk GUI for accessing all the testing
results. Hope these are helpful to anyone, I'd like to collect more
from the net as they get developed.
